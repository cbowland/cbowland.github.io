  <h2 id="the-enterprise-impact-of-containers">The Enterprise Impact Of Containers</h2>
<p>The packaging of applications into containers and running them as sandboxed linux processes instead of on virtual machines is becoming increasingly popular across all verticals as well as types of applications. No longer the sole domain of microservice architecture, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) are choosing to packing their products as containers in order to take advantage of three trends within enterprise IT — moving from monolithic applications, past n-tier applications, and towards applications that are fully distributed and decoupled; leaving behind waterfall development process to enable agile and dev/ops approaches to application development; and choosing to run increasing percentages of workloads outside of both internal as well as hosted data centers and in true cloud environments. Container technologies are a fundamental driving force for all of these evolutionary changes.</p>
<h2 id="why-isvs-choose-openshift">Why ISVs Choose OpenShift</h2>
<p>All of those containers have to run somewhere and the industry has generally settled on Kubernetes as the “winner” of the container-orchestration wars with other previously competing technologies now adopting it as the basis for their own platforms. Using a Kubernetes-based platform, while providing for a standard way to deploy and scale containerized workloads, does in and of itself offer consistency across the many other requirements for a platform such as security, logging, metrics, monitoring, storage, platform upgrades, support, etc&hellip;.</p>
<h3 id="ubiquitous-platform">Ubiquitous Platform</h3>
<p>When an ISV is choosing what platforms to run their software on and thus what platforms their customers will need to use, one of the key components of that decision is the ubiquity of the platform or its market-addressable space. Unlike all of the other Kubenetes-based systems, including those provided by the major cloud providers as well as those built and maintained by internal operations teams, OpenShift provides a common layer of abstraction so that an ISV who has chosen to deploy on OpenShift knows that their software has the broadest possible market-addressable space and will run without modification anywhere that OpenShift runs. Additionally, this has the important benefit of holding down development, training, and support costs for the ISV as the vagaries of multiple different platforms can be streamlined or avoided altogether.</p>
<h3 id="more-than-kubernetes">More Than Kubernetes</h3>
<p>Operationalizing enterprise software is much more than just getting the applications to run. In the diagram below, OpenShift is represented as a stack of supporting layers, environments in which it can be installed (physical, virtual, cloud, edge) to the Kubernetes orchestration functions, to cluster services, and finally a series of higher level services focusing on platform management, application development, data management, and application integrations.</p>
<p><img src="/OpenShiftLayerCake.png" alt="OpenShift Layer Cake"></p>
<p>The only piece of this diagram that is specific to a “vanilla” Kubernetes platform is the orchestration layer in the center. Everything else, both up and down the stack, is relegated to each Kubernetes distribution and each of them handles them differently (including OpenShift).
What makes OpenShift so attractive for ISVs is that the technologies and choices it contains are 1) best-of-breed and industry leading (RHEL, Istio, Tekton, Kafka, AMQ, Helm, etc…) and 2) consistent across all of the footprints at the bottom of the diagram. Which means OpenShift provides a consistent and repeatable experience regardless of where it runs.</p>
<h2 id="why-customers-choose-openshift">Why Customers Choose OpenShift</h2>
<p>Customers also benefit from many OpenShift’s features that make it so attractive to ISVs. Vendor lock-in concerns now apply to the cloud providers and hyperscalers. Using OpenShift, however, customers can swing their applications between clouds without needing significant retooling as long as they are running OpenShift in each.</p>
<p>Applications, whether developed in-house or provided by an ISV, do not generally exist in a vacuum. Data, messaging, transformation, and other services may need to be deployed as well. OpenShift has a tremendous amount of value for application delivery and deployments that customers could leverage as they build ecosystems around their major applications.</p>
<h3 id="deploying-software">Deploying Software</h3>
<p>Inside the Developer Catalog, where OpenShift administrators can predetermine the available options based on their organization’s needs, developers can quickly choose to deploy software from a variety of of locations (source code repositories, image repositories, local or remote file systems) and with a variety of formats (raw code with builder images, dev files, templates, plain yaml, helm charts, docker files, pre-build container images)</p>
<p><img src="/OpenShiftDeveloperCatalog.png" alt="OpenShift Developer Catalog"></p>
<p>Regardless of whether the developer is trying to deploy an application from source or is perhaps integrating an ISV-supplied container image, OpenShift simplifies the process and automates many of the necessary steps such as checking out and building code, creating kubernetes objects like deployments, pods, and services, pushing and pulling content to and from  images registries, and even creating ingress into the application (if applicable).</p>
<h3 id="operator-hub">Operator Hub</h3>
<p>Introduced by CoreOS (which was later acquired by Red Hat) in 2016, Kubernetes Operators are a way to package, deploy and manage a Kubernetes-native application. A Kubernetes-native application is an application that is both deployed on Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes APIs and native tooling (like kubectl).</p>
<p>Conceptually, Operators take human operational knowledge and build it into software that is then more easily shared with consumers. Operators are themselves software that ease the operational complexity of running another piece of software. They act like an extension of the software vendor’s engineering team, watching over a Kubernetes environment (such as OpenShift) and using its current state to make decisions about installation, upgrades, backups, metrics, failure recovery, and more (depending on their maturity) in real time.</p>
<p><img src="/OperatorMaturityModel.png" alt="Operator Maturity Model"></p>
<p>With Operators, developers and Kubernetes administrators can gain the automation advantages of public cloud-like services, including provisioning, scaling, and backup/restore, while enabling the portability of the services across Kubernetes environments regardless of the underlying infrastructure.</p>
<p>OperatorHub.io is designed to be the public registry for finding Kubernetes Operator backed services.</p>
<p><img src="/OperatorHub.png" alt="Operator Hub"></p>
<p>To be listed on OperatorHub.io, operators must successfully demonstrate cluster lifecycle features, packaging that can be maintained through the Operator Framework’s Operator Lifecycle Management, and acceptable documentation for its intended users. In addition, OpenShift Certified Operators have been validated beyond the basic tests performed for the community Operators from OperatorHub.io.</p>
<p>With Red Hat OpenShift Certified Operators, partners can now look to Red Hat to manage updates for OpenShift releases. Partners also work with Red Hat for security vulnerability response and automated rebuilding of container images and can offer their products with joint, commercial support on OpenShift.</p>
<p>The OperatorHub is the web console interface in OpenShift Container Platform that cluster administrators use to discover and install Operators. With one click, an Operator can be pulled from its off-cluster source, installed and subscribed on the cluster, and made ready for engineering teams to self-service manage the product across deployment environments using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).</p>
<p><img src="/OpenShiftOperatorHub.png" alt="OpenShift Operator Hub"></p>
<h3 id="red-hat-marketplace">Red Hat Marketplace</h3>
<p>Launched in the fall of 2020, the Red Hat Marketplace is an open cloud marketplace that makes it easy to discover and access Red Hat certified software for container-based environments in both public clouds and on-premise installations. It was created to help developers using Red Hat OpenShift to build and deploy solutions across multiple clouds, on-premises or on the edge and includes a  catalog of partner operators, simplified setup scripts for deployment, and pay-as-you-go metering for select operators</p>
<p><img src="/RedHatMarketplace.png" alt="Red Hat Marketplace"></p>
<p>When installed into an OpenShift cluster, the Red Hat Marketplace becomes another source of Operators within the OperatorHub inside OpenShift. This gives administrators the same control they have over other operator-based software within the cluster while enabling developers to quickly select and deploy the applications without having to find additional outside sources that might not be appropriate for or approved by their organization.</p>
